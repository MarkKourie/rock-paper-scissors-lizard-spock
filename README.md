# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK

Yes, I know it was supposed to be a simple rock, paper, scissors game, but being that guy who always wants to be different, I made it a bit more complex.

The underlying structure of the game is the same, it just uses a few more conditions because you have five choices to play rather than three. 

If anyone actually reads this and looks at my code, I would be more than happy to receive your comments.
